This is Responsive Portfolio Website developed using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
This website is comprises of multiple sections like Introduction, About, Skills, Projects and Contact details.
I have used multiple creative animations to make website for appealing and catchy.
To make HTML form working i have used javascript and smtp.js to handle this user responses.
To make our data secure i have used a secure token which hides the vulnerable data fields.
If you want to run above code files than you just have to do following process:
1-Install and open github repository in vscode compiler.
2- Since i have not used any JavaScript framework like react.js or vue.js ,  so this will help easily running file on live server.
3-Just create an account on smtp.js and then verify your email after this you will get UserID and Password just use it to build connection from HTML form to Email Inbox.
4-And at last you just need protect that userID and the Password using Secure Tokens which will encrypt our data.
5- At last you can just deploy the website over any platform, i have used netlify for this project.
You can access my Website using this link -  "https://shreyashboss-portfolio.netlify.app/"
That's all from my side. Happy Coding!!
